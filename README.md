This is a simple front-end web page application.
It will consist of a single index.html page with an organized architecture to house the behavior and style of the webpage in separate folders.
There is no database connection or other incoming data and therefore is not intended to be dynamic.
The hope is to utilize this project for practice designing front-end applications, bootstrap/Sass and perhaps javascript and jQuery.
Lastly, the intent is to host the site on AWS.
